This project implements a **Car Parking System** using Verilog HDL. It simulates the logic of monitoring and controlling car entries and exits in a parking lot, with features such as gate control, slot counting, and status indication.

## ðŸš— Project Overview

The Car Parking System is designed to:

- Monitor the number of cars entering and exiting the parking lot
- Detect parking slot availability
- Control entry and exit gates
- Display system status (e.g., FULL/AVAILABLE)

This system is ideal for learning Verilog-based hardware design and understanding digital logic control systems.
